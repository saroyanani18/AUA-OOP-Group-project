Stock market simulator-Group 32
This project is a small project, which was assigned for Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming class.
It uses only Java and is mostly concentrated on Object Oriented Programming.
It is a simple Stock Market Simmulator game which gives you stocks which you can buy and sell and other functionalities too.
It was created in order to understand the concepts of OOP which we used to create this project.
Over the time it was updated and it was made into a better program by adding swing and some graphical user interface.
